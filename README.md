# CHANS_SD
The CHANS-YRB-SD model was developed based on the VENSIM DSS 9.3 software platform. 
The model includes six files, two for model execution, two simulation results, two validation data file.
Ensure that 'CHANS_YRB_SD_V1.mdl' and 'data_input_vensim.xls' are stored in the same folder. 
Then, open 'YRBmodel_ten_model.mdl' using Vensim DSS software, click the Run button, and the model will execute. 
'data_input_vensim.xls' is the exogenous input data required for simulation.
For 'data_input_vensim.xls', variables shown in purple indicate those that vary under the future baseline scenario, with their projected values also displayed in purple.
'TENmodule_couple_his.vdfx' is the simulation results for the historical period, only support by the Vensim.
'TENmodule_future_BAU.vdfx'	is the simulation results for baseline scenario, only support by the Vensim.
'ture data.vdfx' is the	validation file for the historical period, only support by the Vensim.
'YRBdata_true2020.xls' is the validation data for the historical period.
'parameters_in_model.xls' is the summary of parameters in the model.
Vensim PLE allows users to view the model but does not support model execution.
