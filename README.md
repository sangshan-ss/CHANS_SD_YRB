# CHANS-SD-YRB
The CHANS-SD-YRB model was developed based on the VENSIM DSS 9.3 software platform. 
The released model version V1.0 package includes model files for execution, simulation results files, data files for validation, and parameters summary file.
Ensure that 'CHANS_SD_YRB_V1.mdl' and 'data_input_vensim.xls' are in the same folder. 
Then, open 'YRBmodel_ten_model.mdl' using Vensim DSS software, click the Run button, and the model will execute. 
'data_input_vensim.xls' is the exogenous input data required for simulation.
For 'data_input_vensim.xls', variables shown in purple indicate those that vary under the future baseline scenario, with their projected values also displayed in purple.
'TENmodule_couple_his.vdfx' is the simulation results for the historical period, only support by the Vensim, can download from 10.5281/zenodo.17568963.
'TENmodule_future_Baseline.vdfx'	is the simulation results for baseline scenario, only support by the Vensim, can download from 10.5281/zenodo.17568963.
'ture data.vdfx' is the	validation file for the historical period, only support by the Vensim.
'YRBdata_true2020.xls' is the validation data for the historical period.
'parameters_in_model.xls' is the summary of parameters in the model.
Note that the Vensim PLE allows users to view the model but does not support model execution.
